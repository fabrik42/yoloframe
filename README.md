ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯ **Introducing the** ðŸ†ˆðŸ…¾ðŸ…»ðŸ…¾**frame** ðŸ’¯ðŸ‘ŒðŸ’¯

Good news everyone!

Today I would like to share a little pet project of mine. ðŸ¤“

---

It's a digital picture frame that I keep in the background of my video calls.

It shows only the latest images and **everyone can just upload new ones**.

---

_What could go wrong?_

I call this project the **_YOLOframe_**.

Right now, the address of said yoloframe is only known to [iokians](https://ioki.com) so we use it to have fun at our workplace.

These were the instructions shared, how to participate:

# Totally a good idea!

The idea behind this is, that we can all share a common thing in our homeoffice - the picture frame (aka the website that shows the images).

So uploading an image will not only make my day better and funnier, but that of many people.

And even if we might not see it, we will all share a laugh.

# Be a part of it!

Here is what you can do now:

## ðŸ–¼ Setup your own YOLOframe

Join the fun and decorate your workplace with a tablet or another second screen that shows the digital picture frame.

Then, head over to #yoloframe and share a picture of your YOLOframe setup with the rest of us.

Hint: On an iPad, you can just open the URL in Safari and then choose "Add to homescreen" to get a full screen version of it. But you should disable screen lock as well.

## ðŸ’¾ Upload images for all of us

Share the experience and decorate the home of many iokians with totally responsibly chosen images that you upload on the uploader site.

Have a good Friday folks! ðŸ”¥

# Setup

## Software

- Of course `npm install`...
- Create a cloudinary account
  - Set the uploader credentials in `public/uploader.html`
  - Set the admin API credentials as env variables to be used in `server.js`'
- That's it!


## Picture Frame

The picture frame is just an iPad that I strapped to a wooden frame.

I opened the yoloframe viewer website and added it to the home screen.

Make sure that auto screenlock is turned off.

Also, in order to prevent reflections while filming the frame, try to reduce screen brightness. Setting the brightness of the iPad to around 10% works best for me.
